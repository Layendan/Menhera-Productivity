# Menhera Productivity

This project is a machine learning-supported productivity application built using Tauri, SvelteKit, and PyTorch. Programmed using Rust and TypeScript, along with Python for training a machine learning model.

Project submission for Innovation Hacks 2025 Hackathon GDSC challenge.

## Topic: AI For Productivity

Maintaining peak productivity while studying or working is tougher than ever - distractions like phones, social media, or even zoning out at your desk make it tough to stay on task. Timers and to-do lists help, but they don't keep you accountable in the moment. Your challenge is to design a solution that helps individuals stay on task by identifying moments of drift and guiding them back into a productive state.

## Origin of Menhera

"Menhera-chan" or Kurumi Nanase (Japanese: 七瀬くるみ) is a fictional character produced by the Japanese company Joynet and illustrated by the company's designer Pom (ぽむ). The character first appeared on the company's product line as stickers for the instant messenger app LINE on December 27th, 2017, and had a serialized manga that began on Pom's official website on May 8th. For further history and information on the character, see: https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/kurumi-nanase
